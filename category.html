<h3> HUSET's Volunteer Values</h3>
        <p>
The House-KBH is largely based on voluntary fire-souls who, with their creative, quirky, fun and different ideas create cultural experiences for the House's many guests. We believe that the volunteers help to ensure that the program of the house is versatile and diverse. The house's philosophy is based on involvement and collaboration and we collaborate with a lot of different creative associations and entrepreneurs to create cultural experiences that can not be found anywhere else in Copenhagen. There is therefore ample opportunity to participate and bring new ideas into play as a volunteer in Huset-KBH.
